Well...I did porifera. \

I did it really well.

I did it for hours. Days. Multiple days.

And then it got deleted because I this is my 8th time trying to make a New Project that somehow also successfully Gits. I keep repeating the first steps over and over to make it into a git thing.

So you are not getting my answers because they are gone and at this point I am sobbing. usethis::use_git()
